# Data-Cleaning-SQL

Tools used: _SQL Server (T-SQL)_

This was a projects I wanted to do in order to improve my knowledge of data cleaning in SQL.
It takes in a set of Housing Data including, _date, address, duplicate rows etc_

The goal was to:
- Change and standardize and change Date formats
- Populate missing/NULL data _(property address data)_
- Breaking out text data into individual columns _(address, city, state)_
- Standardize and change text data _(example change text from 'Y' to 'Yes')_
- Remove Duplicates
- Delete unused columns
